This chronological narrative is divided into major sections with headings and sub-headings to illustrate how it flows together. Clicking the "+" or "-" will expand or collapse each section. The the up and down arrows open and close the blocks of biblical text.

Each section also lists common places, people groups, and themes. If you click on one of those tags, you will see a list of each time it appears in the narrative. Each also section lists the passage references contained therein.

You navigate seperately to each of the six major sections and use the three line option button in the bottom right corner to see the outline of that section.

The other buttons allow you to quickly expand and collapse, switch between major sections, and search.
