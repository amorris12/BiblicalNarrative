God chose to preserve His Word to us in the Bible. It records the true story of His interactions with us throughout time in His desire to renew us into relationship with Him.

Each Book of the Bible was written at a particular moment for a specific purpose to a given audience. As we have the privilege of reading all the Books we can see a unified and chronologically consistent story.

The purpose of this site is to harmonize the narrative details from the various biblical books into a single cohesive unit.

This gives us a refined sense of how each remarkable episode of God's provision and guidance along with the successes and failures of God's people fit as one and how they connect in time.
